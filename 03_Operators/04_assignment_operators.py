# Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables.

# Operator	Description	Example
# =	Assign	a = 5
# +=	Add and assign	a += 3
# -=	Subtract and assign	a -= 2
# *=	Multiply and assign	a *= 4
# /=	Divide and assign	a /= 2
# %=	Modulus and assign	a %= 3
# **=	Exponentiate and assign	a **= 2
# //=	Floor divide and assign	a //= 2

a = a + 3  # Traditional way
a += 3     # Using += operator

# Assignment Operators
a = 10

a += 5  # Equivalent to a = a + 5
print("a += 5:", a)

a -= 3  # Equivalent to a = a - 3
print("a -= 3:", a)

a *= 2  # Equivalent to a = a * 2
print("a *= 2:", a)

a /= 4  # Equivalent to a = a / 4
print("a /= 4:", a)

a %= 3  # Equivalent to a = a % 3
print("a %= 3:", a)

a **= 2  # Equivalent to a = a ** 2
print("a **= 2:", a)

a //= 2  # Equivalent to a = a // 2
print("a //= 2:", a)
